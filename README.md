## Hi

I enjoy programming with HTML, python and lower level languages such as C++.

My main ideas for the future are:
- To make a game engine 🎮
- To make an operating system 🪟 🍎 🐧 💻
- To make a game 🎮
- To make a programming language 💻 ⌨

I really like doing things from scratch - I prefer to code my own library rather than use somebody else's. Unfortunately, this can become very time consuming! 😆
